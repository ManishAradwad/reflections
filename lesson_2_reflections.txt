What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
->When you initialize a repository, that repository will now be tracked by git. A hidden '.git' folder will be created in that repository which links that repository to github.This helps us to keep track of all the files in that directory we'll be making changes to.

How is the staging area different from working directory and the repository? What values do you think it offers?
->Staging area is a kind of intermediate level between a directory and a repository. Staging area offers a validation that we want to add these commits and at the same time it also increases productivity by adding changes of multiple files to the same commit.
