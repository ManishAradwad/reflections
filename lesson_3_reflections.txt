When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
->Remote repository can also be used as a backup of files in local repository. The remote repository is also useful while collaborating with people on a project since everyone can contribute to our reository remotely. This advantage is possible only because remote repository is hosted on a server.

Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
->If Git automatically pulls all the changes in the local repository from Github then it might become a tedious network of commits and generally only those commits are pulled which are related to the project I am currently working on. I dont need thode commits which does not have anything to do with my project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one intead of another?
->Forking means creating a copy of already present repository on your github and we do it generally when we want another repository as a base and if we want to create changes in one's repository but don't wanna change his version
  Cloning means creating a local version of a github repository on your devise to change it without changin
the original repository
  Branching means we commit diiferent changes into one single file according to our convenience. Main branch, Master is kept for the stable version while other branhces are created to introduce new experimental features 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
->While working offline it is safe to have a copy of the remote stored locally since I know the state of the remote version of repository at some point of time. I can merge those remote changes with local changes anytime and then access the remote version(if updated) after coming online
